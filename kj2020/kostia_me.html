				<article>The letter ‘s’ stands for sociable. Although I cannot say I was like that all the time, a few last years proved that I am now. It is easy for me to start a conversation with a total stranger, ask or receive a piece of advice from a person I was not communicating too long. It has its own positive and negative sides, obviously, but what I am sure is that I can bring something positive and productive to every community I belong to. This happens thanks to my ability to express my thoughts openly and knowledge of how to interact with others.</article>

				<article>The A stands for ambitious. Since my childhood, I was dreaming about achieving something big in my life. The goal was and actually continues changing constantly, but nowadays at least it keeps the same professional sphere. No matter what that goal is, it is utterly important that striving to achieve something makes me develop my skills, widen my knowledge, and even improve my social behaviour.</article>

			</section>
			<section class="col-lg-6">
			<div class="box">
				<article>The F stands for flexible. As I mentioned above, I come across different people in different communities, like EYP, studies, work etc. And in every community, I think I am its more or less valuable part, although they may differ quite a lot. More to say, I do not lose myself as I am when coming to a new community with interests others than mine – my flexibility is to find common things in me and a community and emphasise those in myself.</article>

			<section class="col-lg-6">
			<div class="box">
				<article>The last letter, E, stands for ‘emotive’. For me, it is easier to survive when I react to things that surround me. Of course, I try to hide negative emotions from everyone, just share them with the closest people, and open positive ones. Thus, I try to create a more positive emotional environment, which is important for everyone. People consider me as one who would rather honestly share emotions with them than keep them.</article>
