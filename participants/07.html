		<article>Ledi Dzhank group was founded in Kyiv in 2014, consisting of: Sergey Gusak - vocals, Ilya Sluchanko - guitar, Mikhail Burlakov - bass, Sergey Gavrilov - drums. Under their female name hides one hundred percent male band, and the musical style is built on contrast: because you don't expect candid lyrics from secret guys. Thus, between the female and male, cold and passion, positive "lady" and negative "junk" there is a powerful electric charge. Guitar riffs, catchy vocals, and sensual Ukrainian lyrics will not leave you indifferent. In 2015, two EPs were released: "Bude shcho skazaty" and "#2", the songs of which were included in several music ratings in late 2015. The song "Nezaimani" was included in the list of the 100 best musical works according to Cultprostir. The band was recognized as a discovery on Radio A, and Inspired marked the EP "Bude shcho skazaty" in the ranking of the best albums of 2015.</article>
